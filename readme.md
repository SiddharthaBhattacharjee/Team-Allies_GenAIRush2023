Saha-AI is an innovative call management system that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to help prioritize emergency calls when no handlers are available. By analyzing the keywords and recording the location of callers, Saha-AI can grade the importance of each call and quickly transfer the relevant information to the respective handler. This system helps emergency services to respond more efficiently and effectively to urgent situations.

## ‚ú® Features

- AI-powered call management: Saha-AI uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to identify the urgency of each call and prioritize them accordingly.
- Call grading : Saha-AI grades each call based on the sevierity of situation spoken by the caller. This allows the system to quickly identify urgent calls and transfer them to the emergency handler.
- Location tracking: Saha-AI also records the location of each caller and provides this information to the handler.
- Call transcript: Saha-AI provides a transcript of each call to the emergency handler, allowing them to quickly and accurately assess the situation and respond accordingly.
- Automated responses: In some cases, Saha-AI can provide automated responses to callers to guide them through emergency situations until an emergency handler is available.
- Chat Assistance: In cases when someone needs general consultancy for emergency situation , the chat feature can be used to get quick and reliable consultancy.
- SOS Numbers: For older people or children, it is important that a guardian is informed in case of any emergency involving them, hence using the SOS number feature, the SOS number is notified if any emergency call is made.

## ü§î The problem faced by most of us today

In emergency situations, every second counts. However, when the emergency call center is overwhelmed or understaffed, callers may have to wait for a long time before their call is answered. This delay can be critical and could result in a loss of life or property. Our hackathon project, Saha-AI, solves this problem by using artificial intelligence to grade the importance of each call and transfer the relevant information to the emergency handler. This helps emergency services to respond more efficiently and effectively, potentially saving lives and reducing property damage.

## ‚úÖ How Saha-AI Works

When a caller dials the handler and there are no available handlers, the call is automatically redirected to the Saha-AI system. The system then asks the caller to describe the emergency situation and uses NLP and ML algorithms to analyze the content of the call. Based on the keywords and phrases used by the caller, the system grades the importance of the call and assigns it a priority level.

If the call is urgent, Saha-AI will immediately transfer the relevant information to the handler. This information includes the caller's location, a transcript of the call, and any other relevant details. If the call is less urgent, Saha-AI may provide automated responses to guide the caller through the situation until a emergency handler is available.
